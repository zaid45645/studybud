    <h1>About StudyBud 🏫 </h1>
    <p>
        StudyBud was built by Mohammed Zaid in the neev event #neevaikyam on 28th and 29th of August 2024 <br>
        it features tools helping studnents and teachers connect together through an online platform, <br>
        as in 2024 I have faced a lot problems of not having a good platform with everything and all, <br>
        thats why I was insipired to make this. Thank You!
